1. **Objective**: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/eZGMjp/.

2. **Rule #1**: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.

3. **Rule #2**: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

4. **Rule #3**: You must use both Sass and React to build this project.

5. **User Story**: I can see a table of the Free Code Camp campers who've earned the most brownie points in the past 30 days.

6. **User Story**: I can see how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days, and how many they've earned total.

7. **User Story**: I can toggle between sorting the list by how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days and by how many brownie points they've earned total.

8. **Hint**: To get the top 100 campers for the last 30 days: https://fcctop100.herokuapp.com/api/fccusers/top/recent.

9. **Hint**: To get the top 100 campers of all time: https://fcctop100.herokuapp.com/api/fccusers/top/alltime.
